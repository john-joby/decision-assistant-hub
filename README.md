# Decision Assistant Hub

The **Decision Assistant Hub** is the companion repository to the [Decision Assistant](#), an AI-powered assistant that helps users turn business policies into structured decision models like rulesets and DMN diagrams.

This hub provides **curated examples**, **tutorials**, **tips**, and **video walkthroughs** to help you understand how to work with the assistant and apply it to real-world decision automation scenarios.
  

## Purpose
